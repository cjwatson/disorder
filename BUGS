* Compilation Bugs

The configure script make pointless checks for C++ and Fortran compilers.  This
is a bug in Libtool not in DisOrder.  See: http://bugs.debian.org/221873

* Server Bugs

* Other Problems

** Wrongly Specified Character Encoding

A problem was reported where DisOrder was misconfigured to believe a UTF-8
filesystem was actually an ISO-8859-1 filesystem.  When it was reconfigured
correctly, the old (mangled) filenames remain in the database.

This is not a bug as such, it is a configuration error.  However recovering
from it can be painful if many filenames are involved.  If this mistake is
widespread then it may be worth adding support for automatic recovery, but for
now the easiest answer is to stop the server, remove the databases and start
again.

** Poor Sound Quality

Poor sound quality may be a result of (hitherto unknown!) bugs in DisOrder, or
may be a problem with other software or hardware.  Specific combinations that
have produced problems in the past are listed here.

*** Stutter with VIA 82C686

Hardware: "VT82C686 AC97 Audio Controller"
Software: Linux via82cxxx_audio driver
Symptom: Stuttering playback with raw format play.
Solution: Use snd-via82xx driver instead (from ALSA).

ALSA drivers can be found in Linux 2.6.x; for 2.4.x they must be built
separately.

I would that some instances of this chipset appear to work incredibly badly
even with ALSA.
