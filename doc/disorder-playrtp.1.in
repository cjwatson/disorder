.TH disorder-playrtp 1
.SH NAME
disorder-playrtp \- play DisOrder network broadcasts
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B disorder\-playrtp
.RI [ OPTIONS ]
.RB [ \-\- ]
.RI [[ GROUP ]
.IR PORT ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdisorder\-playrtp\fR plays a network broadcast sent from the specified
address.
.PP
If neither a group nor port are specified then the local DisOrder
configuration is consulted to find the server and the server is asked where the
RTP stream is.
.PP
If just a port is specified then the RTP stream is assumed to be unicast or
broadcast to that port.
.PP
If a group and a port are specified then the RTP stream is assumed to be
multicast to that group and port.
.SH OPTIONS
The default sound API is the first of the ones listed below that are available.
Usually this implies ALSA under Linux and Core Audio under OS X.
.TP
.B \-\-alsa\fR, \fB-\a
Use ALSA to play sound.
.TP
.B \-\-oss\fR, \fB\-o
Use OSS to play sound.
.TP
.B \-\-core\-audio\fR, \fB\-c
Use Core Audio to play sound.
.TP
.B \-\-device \fIDEVICE\fR, \fB\-D \fIDEVICE\fR
Specifies the audio device to use.
The exact meaning of this is platform-dependent; on Linux it is the
ALSA device name.
.TP
.B \-\-config \fIPATH\fR, \fB\-C \fIPATH
Set the configuration file.
The default is
.IR pkgconfdir/config .
.TP
.B \-\-socket \fIPATH\fR, \fB\-s \fIPATH
Set the control socket.
Normally this would not be used manually.
.TP
.B \-\-help\fR, \fB\-h
Display a usage message.
.TP
.B \-\-version\fR, \fB\-V
Display version number.
.SS "Buffer Control Options"
You shouldn't need to use these options.
.TP
.B \-\-min \fIFRAMES\fR, \fB\-m \fIFRAMES\fR
Specifies the buffer low watermark in frames.
If the number of frames falls below this value then playing will be
stopped until the buffer fills up.
.TP
.B \-\-buffer \fIFRAMES\fR, \fB\-b \fIFRAMES\fR
Specifies the buffer high watermark in frames.
Once there are this many frames in the buffer, playing will be (re-)started.
.TP
.B \-\-max \fIFRAMES\fR, \fB\-x \fIFRAMES\fR
Specifies the maximum buffer size in frames.
If there are this many frames in the buffer then reading from the
network socket will be suspended.
The default is four times the \fB\-\-buffer\fR value.
.TP
.B \-\-rcvbuf \fIBYTES\fR, \fB\-R \fIBYTES\fR
Specifies socket receive buffer size.
The default is 131072 (128Kbytes).
The buffer size will not be reduced below the operating system's default.
.SH "REMOTE CONTROL"
The
.B \-\-socket
option is used by Disobedience to control a background
.B disorder\-playrtp
daemon.
The socket will be created as a UNIX domain stream socket.
When a connection is received a single line is read from it.
The following commands are known:
.TP
.B stop
Causes
.B disorder\-playrtp
to terminate.
.TP
.B query
Causes the string "running" to be sent back.
.PP
Other commands are ignored.
After the first command the connection is closed.
Only one connection at a time will be serviced.
.PP
This protocol is not guaranteed to be stable.
