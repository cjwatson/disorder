.TH disorder-playrtp 1
.SH NAME
disorder-playrtp \- play DisOrder network broadcasts
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B disorder\-playrtp
.RI [ OPTIONS ]
.RB [ \-\- ]
.RI [[ ADDRESS ]
.IR PORT ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdisorder\-playrtp\fR plays a network broadcast sent from the specified
address.
.PP
If neither an address nor port are specified then the local DisOrder
configuration is consulted to find the server and the server is asked where the
RTP stream is.
.PP
If just a port is specified then the RTP stream is assumed to be unicast or
broadcast to that port.
.PP
If an address and a port are specified then the RTP stream is assumed to be
multicast to that group address and port.
.SH OPTIONS
The default sound API is the first of the ones listed below that are available.
Usually this implies ALSA under Linux and Core Audio under OS X.
.TP
.B \-\-alsa\fR, \fB\-a
Use ALSA to play sound.
Only available on Linux.
.TP
.B \-\-oss\fR, \fB\-o
Use OSS to play sound.
Only available on Linux and FreeBSD.
.TP
.B \-\-core\-audio\fR, \fB\-c
Use Core Audio to play sound.
Only available on Macs.
.TP
.B \-\-device \fIDEVICE\fR, \fB\-D \fIDEVICE\fR
Specifies the audio device to use.
See
.B "DEVICE NAMES"
below for more information.
.TP
.B \-\-command \fICOMMAND\fR, \fB-e \fICOMMAND\fR
Instead of sending to a physical audio device, invoke \fICOMMAND\fR using the
shell and write audio samples to its standard input.
Currently the input will be 44100KHz 16-bit signed stereo samples.
If \fICOMMAND\fR exits it is re-executed; any samples that had been written to
the pipe but not processed by the previous instance will be lost.
.IP
.B \-\-device
is redundant with this option.
.IP
As an example,
.B "-e \(aqcat > dump\(aq"
would log audio data to a file for later processing.
You could convert it to another format with, for instance:
.IP
.B "sox -c2 -traw -r44100 -s -w dump dump.wav"
.TP
.B \-\-config \fIPATH\fR, \fB\-C \fIPATH
Set the configuration file.
The default is
.IR pkgconfdir/config .
.TP
.B \-\-socket \fIPATH\fR, \fB\-s \fIPATH
Set the control socket.
Normally this would not be used manually.
.TP
.B \-\-help\fR, \fB\-h
Display a usage message.
.TP
.B \-\-version\fR, \fB\-V
Display version number.
.SS "Buffer Control Options"
You shouldn't need to use these options.
.TP
.B \-\-min \fIFRAMES\fR, \fB\-m \fIFRAMES\fR
Specifies the buffer low watermark in frames.
If the number of frames falls below this value then playing will be
stopped until the buffer fills up.
.TP
.B \-\-buffer \fIFRAMES\fR, \fB\-b \fIFRAMES\fR
Specifies the buffer high watermark in frames.
Once there are this many frames in the buffer, playing will be (re-)started.
.TP
.B \-\-max \fIFRAMES\fR, \fB\-x \fIFRAMES\fR
Specifies the maximum buffer size in frames.
If there are this many frames in the buffer then reading from the
network socket will be suspended.
The default is four times the \fB\-\-buffer\fR value.
.TP
.B \-\-rcvbuf \fIBYTES\fR, \fB\-R \fIBYTES\fR
Specifies socket receive buffer size.
The default is 131072 (128Kbytes).
The buffer size will not be reduced below the operating system's default.
.SH "REMOTE CONTROL"
The
.B \-\-socket
option is used by Disobedience to control a background
.B disorder\-playrtp
daemon.
The socket will be created as a UNIX domain stream socket.
When a connection is received a single line is read from it.
The following commands are known:
.TP
.B stop
Causes
.B disorder\-playrtp
to terminate.
.TP
.B query
Causes the string "running" to be sent back.
.PP
Other commands are ignored.
After the first command the connection is closed.
Only one connection at a time will be serviced.
.PP
This protocol is not guaranteed to be stable.
.SH "DEVICE NAMES"
.SS "Core Audio"
On a Mac, the device name can either be the human-readable name of the desired
output or its UID.
To get a list of the human-readable names, visit System Preferences -> Sound;
the Type column has the name you want.
.PP
For example, you might use "Built-in Output" for the built-in speaker
or "Built-in Line Output" if you have connected external speakers.
Remember to quote the name.
