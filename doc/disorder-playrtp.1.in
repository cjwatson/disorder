.TH disorder-playrtp 1
.SH NAME
disorder-playrtp \- play DisOrder network broadcasts
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B disorder-playrtp
.RI [ OPTIONS ]
.RB [ -- ]
.I ADDRESS
.I PORT
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdisorder-playrtp\fR plays a network broadcast sent from the specified
address.
.PP
Normally the \fIADDRESS\fR would be 0.0.0.0.  The \fIPORT\fR will depend on the
server configuration.  You may need to specify the \fB--multicast\fR option
(see below) and if you have more than one soundcard perhaps the \fB--device\fR
option.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B --device \fIDEVICE\fR, \fB-D \fIDEVICE\fR
Specifies the audio device to use.  The exact meaning of this is
platform-dependent; on Linux it is the ALSA device name.
.TP
.B --multicast \fIGROUP\fR, \fB-M \fIGROUP\fR
Specifies a multicast group to join.  This is necessary if the network
broadcast is being multicasted rather than broadcast.
.TP
.B --help\fR, \fB-h
Display a usage message.
.TP
.B --version\fR, \fB-V
Display version number.
.SS "Buffer Control Options"
You shouldn't need to use these options.
.TP
.B --min \fIFRAMES\fR, \fB-m \fIFRAMES\fR
Specifies the buffer low watermark in frames.  If the number of frames falls
below this value then playing will be stopped until the buffer fills up.
.TP
.B --buffer \fIFRAMES\fR, \fB-b \fIFRAMES\fR
Specifies the buffer high watermark in frames.  Once there are this many frames
in the buffer, playing will be (re-)started.
.TP
.B --max \fIFRAMES\fR, \fB-x \fIFRAMES\fR
Specifies the maximum buffer size in frames.  If there are this many frames in
the buffer then reading from the network socket will be suspended.  The default
is four times the \fB--buffer\fR value.
.TP
.B --rcvbuf \fIBYTES\fR, \fB-R \fIBYTES\fR
Specifies socket receive buffer size.  The default is 131072 (128Kbytes).  The
buffer size will not be reduced below the operating system's default.
