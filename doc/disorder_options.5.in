.SH NAME
pkgconfdir/options - DisOrder CGI actions
.SH DESCRIPTION
The DisOrder CGI reads much extra configuration information from
\fIpkgconfdir/options\fR.
The general syntax is the same as the main configuration file (see
\fBdisorder_config\fR(5)).
.SH DIRECTIVES
Valid directives are:
.TP
.B columns \fINAME\fR \fIHEADING\fR...
Defines the columns used in \fB@playing@\fR and \fB@recent@\fB.
\fINAME\fR must be either \fBplaying\fR, \fBrecent\fR or \fBsearch\fR.
\fIHEADING\fR...  is a list of heading names.
If a column is defined more than once then the last definitions is used.
.IP
The heading names \fBbutton\fR, \fBlength\fR, \fBwhen\fR and \fBwho\fR
are built in.
.TP
.B include \fIPATH\fR
Includes another file.
If \fIPATH\fR starts with a \fB/\fR then it is taken as is, otherwise
it is searched for in \fIpkgconfdir\fR and \fIpkgdatadir\fR.
.TP
.B label \fINAME\fR \fIVALUE\fR
Define a label.
If a label is defined more than once then the last definition is used.
.SH LABELS
Some labels are defined inside \fBdisorder.cgi\fR and others by the
default templates.
You can define your own labels and use them inside a template.
.PP
When an undefined label is expanded, if it has a dot in its name then
the part after the final dot is used as its value.
Otherwise the whole name is used as the value.
.PP
Labels are not individually documented here, see the shipped
\fIoptions.labels\fR file instead.
.SH "OPTION FILES"
The shipped \fIoptions\fR file includes four standard options files.
In order, they are:
.TP
.I options.labels
The default labels file.
You wouldn't normally edit this directly - instead supply your own commands
in \fIoptions.user\fR.
Have a look at the shipped version of the file for documentation of
labels used by the standard templates.
.TP
.I options.user
A user options file.
Here you should put any overrides for the default labels and any
extra labels required by your modified templates.
