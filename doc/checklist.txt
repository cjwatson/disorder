* Server

After an hour or so of play use lsof to check that only a reasonable
number of FDs are used by the server; the speaker; the deadlock
checker.

* Playing

Check that artist and album work.

Scratch button should work.

Queue some tracks, check they can be removed.

Album link should show track as playing.

Amount of track played should be correct (also 'disorder playing').

* Recent

Most recent should be at the top.

Check that artist, album and prefs links work.

* Choose

Queue some tracks.  They should be marked as queued.

Pick an album.  Try 'play all'.  Check order.  Remove all.

Navigate around.  Go into albums, back out with the navigation links.

Go up outside the collection.  Should work, produce directories you
can go back into.

* Search

Try a large search, e.g. 'love'.

Look for 'Various'.  It should be in the right order and say
'Various', i.e. an alias artist name should not have leaked into it.

* Manage

Check pause and play controls.  Pause should _not crash_ for tracks
that cannot be paused.

Set the volume up and down.

Set the volume to exact values (different for L and R), check that the
proper speaker is affected.

Add some tracks, rearrange them, remove them again.

* Help

Are all the man page links there?

Are recent UI changes documented?

* About

Does the search league look plausible?

Are there are any good candidates for additional stopwords?

Is the copyright date right?  Also check credits.html.

* Preferences

Modify prefs for a track from 'recent'.

Modify prefs for a single track from 'choose'.

Modify prefs for a whole album from 'choose'.
