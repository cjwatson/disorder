.SH NAME
disorder_preferences \- DisOrder global and per-track preferences
.SH "PER-TRACK PREFERENCES"
Currently the following preferences are supported.
Some are expected to be set by users, others updated automatically by plugins.
.TP
.B pick_at_random
If this preference is present and set to "0" then the track will not
be picked for random play.
Otherwise it may be.
.TP
.B played
A decimal integer giving the number times the track was played.
This includes tracks that are scratched or were picked at random.
.TP
.B played_time
The last time the track was played, as a \fBtime_t\fR converted to a
decimal integer.
.TP
.B scratched
The number of times the track has been scratched.
.TP
.B requested
A decimal integer giving the number of times the track was requested.
(Tracks that are removed before being played are not counted.)
.TP
.B tags
Tags that apply to this track, separated by commas.
Tags can contain any printing character except comma.
Leading and trailing spaces are not significant but internal spaces are.
.IP
Using the
.B required\-tags
and
.B prohibited\-tags
global preferences, it is possible to limit the tracks that will be selected at
random.
.TP
.B trackname_\fICONTEXT\fB_\fIPART\fR
These preferences can be used to override the filename parsing rules
to find a track name part.
For backwards compatibility, \fBtrackname_\fIPART\fR will be used
if the full version is not present.
.TP
.B unscratched
The number of times the track has been played to completion without
being scratched.
.TP
.B weight
The weight for this track.  Weights are non-negative integers which determine
the relative likelihood of a track being picked at random (i.e. if track A has
twice the weight of track B then it is twice as likely to be picked at random).
A track with weight 0 will not be picked at random, though \fBpick_at_random\fR
is a more sensible way to configure this.
.IP
The default weight, used if no weight is set or the weight value is invalid, is
90000.  Note that many other factors than track weight affect whether a track
will be played - tracks already in the queue will not be picked at random for
instance.
.IP
The maximum allowed weight is 2147483647.  If you set a larger value it will be
clamped to this value.  Negative weights will be completely ignored and the
default value used instead.
.SH "GLOBAL PREFERENCES"
These are the values set with \fBset\-global\fR.
.TP
.B required\-tags
If this is set an nonempty then randomly played tracks will always have at
least one of the listed tags.
.TP
.B prohibited\-tags
If this is set an nonempty then randomly played tracks will never have any of
the listed tags.
.TP
.B playing
If unset or \fByes\fR then play is enabled.
Otherwise it is disabled.
Use \fBdisable\fR rather than setting it directly.
.TP
.B random\-play
If unset or \fByes\fR then random play is enabled.
Otherwise it is disabled.
Use \fBdisable\fR rather than setting it directly.
.PP
Global preferences starting '_' are read-only (in the sense that you cannot
modify them; the server may modify them as part of its normal operation).
They are:
.TP
.B _dbversion
The database version string.
This is used by DisOrder to detect when it must
modify the database after an upgrade.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
\fBdisorder\fR(1), \fBdisorderd\fR(8), \fBdisorder_config\fR(5)
