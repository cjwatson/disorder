The service name or port number to connect to.
.TP

value to all the other tracks in the window.
For instance, this can be used to efficiently correct the artist or album
fields, or bulk-disable random play for many tracks.

changes but keep the window open and "Cancel" to close the window and discard
all changes.

Select all tracks (queue/recent)
.TP
.B CTRL+L
Brings up the \fBLogin Details Window\fR.
.TP
.B CTRL+Q

.SH "NETWORK PLAY"
Network play uses a background
.BR disorder\-playrtp (1)
process.
If you quit Disobedience the player will continue playing and can be
disabled from a later run of Disobedience.
.PP
The player will log to
.I ~/.disorder/HOSTNAME\-rtp.log
so look there if it does not seem to be working.
.PP
You can stop it without running Disobedience by the command
.BR "killall disorder\-playrtp" .
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-config \fIPATH\fR, \fB\-c \fIPATH
Set the configuration file.
The default is
.IR pkgconfdir/config .
.TP
.B \-\-debug\fR, \fB\-d
Enable debugging.
.TP
.B \-\-help\fR, \fB\-h
Display a usage message.
.TP
.B \-\-version\fR, \fB\-V
Display version number.
.SS "GTK+ Options"
Additional options are supported by the GTK+ library.
Refer to GTK+ documentation for further information.
Under X11 they include:
.TP
.B \-\-display \fIDISPLAY\fR
The X display to use.
.TP
.B \-\-screen \fISCREEN\fR
The screen number to use.
.\" If know enough to use it you know enough to find it
.\" .TP
.\" .B \-\-sync
.\" Make all X requests synchronously.
.SH CONFIGURATION
If you are using
.B disobedience
on the same host as the server then no additional configuration should be
required.
.PP
If it is running on a different host then the easiest way to set it up is to
use the login details window in Disobedience.
Enter the connection details, use Login to connect to the server, and then
use Save to store them for future sessions.
.PP
The other clients read their configuration from the same location so after
setting up with Disobedience, tools such as
.BR disorder (1)
should work as well.
.SH BUGS
Disobedience is newly introduced with DisOrder 2.0.
There are bound to be bugs.
Please send feedback.
.PP
There is no particular provision for multiple users of the same computer
sharing a single \fBdisorder\-playrtp\fR process.
This shouldn't be too much of a problem in practice but something could
perhaps be done given demand.
.SH FILES
.TP
.I ~/.disorder/HOSTNAME\-rtp
Socket for communication with RTP player.
.TP
.I ~/.disorder/HOSTNAME\-rtp.log
Log file for RTP player.
