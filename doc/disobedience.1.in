fields to connect to a remote server.

The service name or port number to connect to.
.TP

The user name to log in as.

The password to use when logging in.
Note that this is NOT your login password but is your password to the
DisOrder server.

.TP
.B Login
This button attempts to (re-)connect to the server with the currently displayed
settings.
The settings are saved in
.IR $HOME/.disorder/passwd .
on success.
.TP

This button closes the window, discarding any unsaved changes.
.SS "Properties Window"
This window contains details of one or more tracks and allows them to be
edited.
.PP
The Artist, Album and Title fields determine how the tracks appear in
the queue and recently played tabs.
.PP
The Tags field determine which tags apply to the track.
Tags are separated by commas and can contain any printing characters except
comma.
.PP
The Weight field determines the track weight.  Tracks with higher weights are
proportionately more likely to be picked at random.  The default weight is
90000, and the maximum weight is 2147483647.
.PP
The Random checkbox determines whether the track will be picked at random.
Random play is enabled for every track by default, but it can be turned off
here.
.PP
The double-headed arrow to the right of each preference will propagate its
value to all the other tracks in the window.
For instance, this can be used to efficiently correct the artist or album
fields, or bulk-disable random play for many tracks.
.PP
Press "OK" to confirm all changes and close the window, "Apply" to confirm
changes but keep the window open and "Cancel" to close the window and discard
all changes.

available to users without admin rights.  The left hand side is a list of all
users; the right hand side contains the editable details of the currently
selected user.
.PP
When you select any user you can edit their email address or change their
password.  It is also possible to edit the individual user rights.  Click on
the "Apply" button to commit any changes you make.
.PP
The "Add" button creates a new user.  You must enter at least a username.
Default rights are setting according to local configuration, \fInot\fR server
configuration (but this may be changed in the future).  As above, click on
"Apply" to actually create the new user.
.PP
The "Delete" button deletes the selected user.  This operation cannot be
undone.

.TP

Select all tracks (queue/recent)
.TP
.B CTRL+L
Brings up the \fBLogin Details Window\fR.
.TP
.B CTRL+Q

.SH "NETWORK PLAY"
Network play uses a background
.BR disorder\-playrtp (1)
process.
If you quit Disobedience the player will continue playing and can be
disabled from a later run of Disobedience.
.PP
The player will log to
.I ~/.disorder/HOSTNAME\-rtp.log
so look there if it does not seem to be working.
.PP
You can stop it without running Disobedience by the command
.BR "killall disorder\-playrtp" .
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-config \fIPATH\fR, \fB\-c \fIPATH

The default is
.IR pkgconfdir/config .
.TP
.B \-\-debug\fR, \fB\-d
Enable debugging.
.TP

.TP
.B \-\-version\fR, \fB\-V

.SS "GTK+ Options"
Additional options are supported by the GTK+ library.
Refer to GTK+ documentation for further information.

.TP
.B \-\-display \fIDISPLAY\fR
The X display to use.
.TP
.B \-\-screen \fISCREEN\fR
The screen number to use.
.\" If know enough to use it you know enough to find it
.\" .TP
.\" .B \-\-sync
.\" Make all X requests synchronously.
.SH CONFIGURATION
If you are using
.B disobedience
on the same host as the server then no additional configuration should be
required.
.PP
If it is running on a different host then the easiest way to set it up is to
use the login details window in Disobedience.
Enter the connection details, use Login to connect to the server, and then
use Save to store them for future sessions.
.PP
The other clients read their configuration from the same location so after
setting up with Disobedience, tools such as
.BR disorder (1)
should work as well.
.SH BUGS
There is no particular provision for multiple users of the same computer
sharing a single \fBdisorder\-playrtp\fR process.
This shouldn't be too much of a problem in practice but something could
perhaps be done given demand.
.PP
Try to do remote user management when the server is configured to refuse this
produces rather horrible error behavior.
.PP
Only one track can be dragged at a time.
.PP
Resizing columns doesn't work very well.
This is a GTK+ bug.
.SH FILES
.TP
.I ~/.disorder/HOSTNAME\-rtp
Socket for communication with RTP player.
.TP
.I ~/.disorder/HOSTNAME\-rtp.log
Log file for RTP player.
