.SH DESCRIPTION
.B disorder\-gstdecode
converts encoded audio files into DisOrder's "raw" format.
It uses the GStreamer library for conversion,
and can decode any kind of audio file
for which the necessary GStreamer plugins are available.
.PP
It is suitable for use as an
.B execraw
player.
.PP
It is not intended to be used from the command line,
but command-line options can usefully be provided
in DisOrder's configuration file.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-help\fR, \fB\-h
Display a usage message.
.TP
.B \-\-version\fR, \fB\-V
Display version number.
.TP
.B \-\-config \fICONFIGFILE\fR, \fB\-c \fICONFIGFILE
Set the configuration file.
.TP
.B \-\-dither \fITYPE\fR, \fB\-d \fIDITHER
Set the dither type used during audio format conversion.
This can be \fBnone\fR,
\fBrpdf\fR for rectangular dithering,
\fBtpdf\fR for triangular dithering, or
\fBtpdf-hf\fR for high-frequency triangular dithering.
Maybe the GStreamer documentation will explain what these mean.
The default is to leave the decision
to GStreamer's \fBaudioconvert\fR plugin.
.TP
.B \-\-fallback-gain \fIGAIN\fR, \fB\-f \fIGAIN
Set the gain to be applied to tracks
which don't have ReplayGain information.
This is in decibels, and will usually be negative.
The default is zero, which is probably wrong.
.TP
.B \-\-noise-shape \fITYPE\fR, \fB-n \fITYPE
Set the noise shaping type used during audio format conversion.
This can be \fBnone\fR,
\fBerror-feedback\fR,
\fBsimple\fR for 2-pole noise shaping,
\fBmedium\fR for 5-pole noise shaping, or
\fBhigh\fR for 8-pole noise shaping.
Maybe the GStreamer documentation will explain what these mean.
The default is to leave the decision
to GStreamer's \fBaudioconvert\fR plugin.
.TP
.B \-\-quality \fIQUALITY\fR, \fB\-q \fIQUALITY
Set the quality level to be used for resampling.
This should be an integer between
0 (poor, but fast) and
10 (good, but slow).
See the GStreamer documentation for more information.
The default is to leave the decision
to GStreamer's \fBaudioresample\fR plugin.
.TP
.B \-\-replay-gain \fIMODE\fR, \fB\-r \fIMODE
Set the ReplayGain mode.
This can be \fBoff\fR to not bother with ReplayGain at all,
\fBtrack\fR to use the per-track gain setting, or
\fBalbum\fR to use the per-album gain setting
(so that the volume level sounds consistent
when playing an entire album).
The default is \fBalbum\fR.
