.TH disorderd 8
.SH NAME
disorderd \- DisOrder jukebox daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B disorderd
.RI [ OPTIONS ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B disorderd
is a daemon which plays audio files and services requests from users
concerning what is to be played.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B --config \fIPATH\fR, \fB-c \fIPATH
Set the configuration file.  The default is
.IR pkgconfdir/config .
See
.BR disorder_config (5)
for further information.
.TP
.B --pidfile \fIPATH\fR, \fB-P \fIPATH
Write a pidfile.
.TP
.B --foreground, \fB-f
Run in the foreground.  (By default,
.B disorderd
detaches from its terminal and runs in the background.)
.TP
.B --debug\fR, \fB-d
Enable debugging.
.TP
.B --help\fR, \fB-h
Display a usage message.
.TP
.B --version\fR, \fB-V
Display version number.
.SH NOTES
.SS "Environmental Dependencies"
It is important that
.B disorder-deadlock
and
.B disorder-rescan
are available on the PATH.  The example "init" script attempts to
ensure this by appending sbindir to the path, but if you have
installed programs in unusual locations then this might not work.
.SS "How To Configure Authentication"
The administrator should create \fIpkgconfdir/config.private\fR, make sure it
is not world-readable, and populate it with \fBallow\fR commands
listing usernames and passwords.  Use
e.g. \fBpwgen\fR(1) to generate random passwords.  Passwords should
then be distributed to users.
.PP
Each user should create the file \fI~/.disorder/passwd\fR
and make sure it is not world-readable.  Having done so
they should add a \fBpassword\fR command to it giving their password (and
optionally a \fBusername\fR command if their DisOrder username is not the
same as their login name).
.SS Locales
.B disorderd
is locale-aware.  If you do not set the locale correctly then it may
not handle non-ASCII data properly.
.PP
Filenames and the configuration file are assumed to be encoded using the
current locale.  The
communication with the client happens in UTF-8 (since the client and the server
don't know what locale each other might be using - in the future they might not
even be on the same host.)
.SS Backups
DisOrder uses Berkeley DB but currently discards log files that are no longer
in use.  This means that DB's catastrophic recovery cannot be used (normal
recovery can be used, and indeed the server does this automatically on
startup).
.PP
It is suggested that instead you just back up the output of
.BR disorder-dump (8),
which saves only the parts of the database that cannot be regenerated
automatically, and thus has relatively modest storage requirements.
.SH SIGNALS
.TP 8
.B SIGHUP
Re-read the configuration file.
.TP
.B SIGTERM
Terminate the daemon gracefully.
.TP
.B SIGINT
Terminate the daemon gracefully.
.PP
It may be more convenient to perform these operations from the client
\fBdisorder\fR(1).
.SH FILES
.TP
.I pkgconfdir/config
Global configuration file.  See \fBdisorder_config\fR(5).
.TP
.I pkgconfdir/config.private
Private configuration (usernames and passwords).
.TP
.I ~/.disorder/passwd
Per-user password file.
.TP
.I pkgstatedir/queue
Saved copy of queue.  Do not edit while the daemon is running.
.TP
.I pkgstatedir/recent
Saved copy of recently played track list.
Do not edit while the daemon is running.
.TP
.I pkgstatedir/prefs.db
Preferences database.
.TP
.I pkgstatedir/search.db
Search database.
.TP
.I pkgstatedir/tracks.db
Tracks database.
.TP
.I pkgstatedir/DB_CONFIG
Berkeley DB configuration file.  This may be used to override database
settings without recompiling DisOrder.  See the Berkeley DB
documention for further details.
.TP
.I pkgstatedir/log.*
Database log files.
.TP
.I pkgstatedir/socket
Communication socket for \fBdisorder\fR(1).
.TP
.I pkgstatedir/lock
Lockfile.  This prevents multiple instances of DisOrder running
simultaneously.
.TP
.I sbindir/disorder-deadlock
Deadlock manager.
.TP
.I sbindir/disorder-rescan
Rescanner.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B LC_ALL\fR, \fBLANG\fR, etc
Current locale.  See \fBlocale\fR(7).
.SH "SEE ALSO"
