.SH NAME
disorder.cgi - DisOrder web interface
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B disorder.cgi
is the web interface for DisOrder.  It runs as a CGI executable under
(for example) Apache.
.PP
By default it will connect as the "guest" user.  This implies that
\fBdisorder setup-guest\fR must have been run on the server for the
CGI to work effectively, though it should be possible to manage
without.
.PP
See \fBdisorder_actions\fR(5) for a description of what the CGI does.
.PP
See \fBdisorder_options\fR(5) for CGI-specific configuration and
\dBdisorder_config\fR(5) for general configuration.
.PP
See \fBdisorder_templates\fR(5) for the template language used.
.SH "WHERE IS IT?"
The DisOrder makefiles don't know where to install the CGI, or indeed
whether you wanted it installed, so they do not install it at all.
You must copy it into the right location according to your web
server's configuration.
