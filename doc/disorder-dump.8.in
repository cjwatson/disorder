.TH disorder-dump 8
.SH NAME
disorder-dump \- DisOrder dump/undump tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B disorder-dump
.RI [ OPTIONS ]
.BR --dump | --undump
.I PATH
.br
.B disorder-dump
.RI [ OPTIONS ]
.BR --recompute-aliases
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B disorder-dump
is used to dump and restore preferences data.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B --dump
Write preferences data to \fIPATH\fR.  This can safely be used whether
or not the server is running.
.TP
.B --undump
Read preferences data from \fIPATH\fR, replacing (unrecoverably) the
current settings.  This should normally only be done while the server
is not running.
.IP
If the server is running then it may hang while the undump completes.
.TP
.B --recover
Perform database recovery at startup.  The server should not be
running if this option is used.
.TP
.B --recompute-aliases
Recompute aliases without dumping or undumping the databases.  Under
normal circumstances this is never necessary.
.TP
.B --remove-pathless
Remove tracks with no associated path when undumping or when
recomputing aliases.  In normal use such tracks are all aliases.
.TP
.B --config \fIPATH\fR, \fB-c \fIPATH
Set the configuration file.  The default is
.IR /etc/disorder/config .
.TP
.B --debug\fR
Enable debugging.
.TP
.B --help\fR, \fB-h
Display a usage message.
.TP
.B --version\fR, \fB-V
Display version number.
.SH NOTES
This program might be used for a number of purposes:
.TP 2
.B .
Taking a backup of the non-regeneratable parts of DisOrder's databases.
.TP
.B .
Indoctrinating one DisOrder server with the preference values of
another.  
.PP
The output file is versioned, so versions produced from a future
version of DisOrder may be rejected by \fB--undump\fR.  It has an end
marker so truncated inputs will also be rejected.
.PP
The input or output file must be a regular file, as it may be rewound
and re-read or re-written multiple times.
.PP
The dump or undump operation is carried out inside a single
transaction, so it should seem atomic from the point of view of
anything else accessing the databases.
.PP
The server performs normal database recovery on startup.  However if
the database needs normal recovery before an undump can succeed and
you don't want to start the server for some reason then the
.B --recover
operation is available for this purpose.  No other process should be
accessing the database at the time.
.PP
DisOrder does not currently support catastrophic recovery.
.PP
This program requires write access to DisOrder's databases.  Ideally
therefore it should be run as the same user as the server or as root.
