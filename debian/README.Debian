Debian package for DisOrder
===========================

The web interface should now start working automatically.  Test it at:

    http://YOURHOSTNAME/cgi-bin/disorder

You will need to create yourself a user.

If it doesn't work, always look at the web server error log and at
/var/log/daemon.log.
