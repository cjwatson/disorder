DisOrder
========

DisOrder is a multi-user software jukebox.
   * It can play either selected tracks or pick tracks at random.
   * It supports OGG, MP3, FLAC and WAV files, and can be configured to support
     anything you can supply a player for (up to a point).
   * It supports both ALSA and OSS and can also broadcast an RTP stream over a
     LAN; a player for the latter is included.
   * Tracks may be selected either via a hierarchical interface or by a fast
     word or tag search.
   * It has a web interface (allowing access from graphical web browsers) and a
     GTK+ interface that runs on Linux and Mac systems.
   * Playing tracks can be paused or cancelled ("scratched").

See CHANGES.html for details of recent changes to DisOrder and
README.upgrades.html for upgrade instructions.

Platform support:
  Linux            Well tested on Debian
  Mac OS X         Disobedience well tested, server somewhat tested; use fink
  FreeBSD          Scantily tested; use ports for dependencies
It could probably be ported to some other UNIX variants without too much
effort.

Build dependencies:
  Name             Tested      Notes
  libdb            4.5.20      not 4.6; 4.[78] seem to be ok
  libgc            6.8
  libvorbisfile    1.2.0
  libpcre          7.6         need UTF-8 support
  libmad           0.15.1b
  libgcrypt        1.4.1
  libasound        1.0.16
  libFLAC          1.2.1
  libsamplerate    0.1.4       currently optional
  GNU C            4.2.1       }
  GNU Make         3.81        } Non-GNU versions will NOT work
  GNU Sed          4.1.5       }
  Python           2.5.2       (optional; 2.4 won't work)
  GTK+             2.12.12     (for the GTK+ client; 2.10 & older will NOT work)
  GLIB             2.16.6      (for the GTK+ client)

"Tested" means I've built against that version; earlier or later versions will
often work too.

For the web interface to work you will additionally need a web server.  I've
had both Apache 1.3.x and 2.x working.  Anything that supports CGI should be
OK.

Installation
============

   "This place'd be a paradise tomorrow, if every department had a supervisor
   with a machine-gun"

IMPORTANT: If you are upgrading from an earlier version, see
README.upgrades.html.

Debian/Ubuntu: steps 1 to 6 are dealt with automatically if you use the .deb
files.

OX X/FreeBSD/other Linux: after installation (step 1 and 2), running
'sudo bash scripts/setup' will cover steps 3 to 6.  If it doesn't work on your
platform, please get in touch.

1. Build the software.  Do something like this:

     ./configure
     make                   # on FreeBSD use gmake

   See INSTALL or ./configure --help for more details about driving configure.

   If you only want to build a subset of DisOrder, specify one or more of the
   following options:
     --without-server       Don't build server or web interface
     --without-gtk          Don't build GTK+ client (Disobedience)
     --without-python       Don't build Python support

   If configure cannot guess where your web server keeps its HTML documents and
   CGI programs, you may have to tell it, for instance:

     ./configure cgiexecdir=/whatever/cgi-bin httpdir=/whatever/htdocs

   See README.client for setting up a standalone client (or read the
   disobedience man page).

   To build .debs on Debian/Ubuntu, use:
     fakeroot debian/rules binary

2. Install it.  Most of the installation is done via the install target:

     make installdirs install

   NB steps 3 to 6 are covered by scripts/setup.  It should work on FreeBSD, OS
   X and Linux and could be adapted to other platforms.

3. Create a 'jukebox' user and group, with the jukebox group being the default
   group of the jukebox user.  The server will run as this user and group.
   Check that this user can read your music files and write to the audio
   device, e.g. by playing a track.  The exact name doesn't matter, it could be
   'jukebox' or 'disorder' or 'fred' or whatever.

   Do not use a general-purpose user or group, you must create ones
   specifically for DisOrder.

4. Create /etc/disorder/config.  Start from examples/config.sample and adapt it
   to your own requirements.  The things you MUST do are:
    * edit the 'collection' command to identify the location(s) of your own
      digital audio files.  These commands also specify the encoding of
      filenames, which you should be sure to get right as recovery from an
      error here can be painful (see BUGS).
   Optionally you may also want to do the following:
    * add 'player' and 'tracklength' commands for any file formats not
      supported natively
    * edit the 'scratch' commands to supply scratch sounds (or delete them if
      you don't want any).
    * add extra 'stopword' entries as necessary (these words won't take part in
      track name searches from the web interface).

   See disorder_config(5) for more details.

   See README.streams for how to set up network play.

   If adding new 'player' commands, see README.raw for details on setting up
   "raw format" players.  Non-raw players are still supported but not in all
   configurations and they cannot support pausing and gapless play.  If you
   want additional formats to be supported natively please point the author at
   a GPL-compatible library that can decode them.

5. Make sure the server is started at boot time.

   On many Linux systems, examples/disorder.init should be more or less
   suitable; install it in /etc/init.d, adapting it as necessary, and make
   appropriate links from /etc/rc[0-6].d.

6. Start the server.

   On Linux systems with sysv-style init:

     /etc/init.d/disorder start

   By default disorderd logs to daemon.*; check your syslog.conf to see where
   this ends up and look for log messages from disorderd there.  If it didn't
   start up correctly there should be an error message.  Correct the problem
   and try again.

7. After a short while it should start to play something.  Try scratching it
   (as root):

     disorder scratch

   The track should stop playing, and (if you set any up) a scratch sound play.

8. Add any other users you want.  These easiest way to do this is (still as
   root):

     disorder authorize USERNAME

   This will automatically choose a random password and create
   ~USERNAME/.disorder/passwd.

   Those users should now be able to access the server from the same host as it
   runs on, either via the disorder command or Disobedience.  To run
   Disobedience from some other host, File->Login allows hostnames, passwords
   etc to be configured.

   Alternatively, after setting up the web interface (below), it's possible to
   allow users to register themselves without operator involvement.

9. Optionally source completion.bash from /etc/profile or similar, for
   example:

     . /usr/local/share/disorder/completion.bash

   This provides completion over disorder command and option names.


Web Interface
=============

   "Thought I was a gonner baby, but I'm bullet proof"

Debian/Ubuntu: the .deb files will do the setup here automatically.

OS X/FreeBSD/other Linux: scripts/setup as referred to above will do the setup
here automatically.

You need to configure a number of things to make this work:

1. If you want online registration to work then set mail_sender in
   /etc/disorder/config to the email address that communications from the web
   interface will appear to be sent.  If this is not a valid, deliverable email
   address then the results are not likely to be reliable.

     mail_sender webmaster@example.com

   By default the web interface sends mail via the system sendmail executable
   (typically /usr/sbin/sendmail or /usr/lib/sendmail).  You can override this
   with the sendmail directive, for example:

     sendmail /usr/sbin/my-sendmail

   The executable you choose must support the -bs option.  Alternatively you
   can tell it to connect to an SMTP server via TCP, with the smtp_server
   directive.  For example:

     smtp_server mail.example.com

   Use 'disorder reconfigure' to make sure the server knows these settings.

2. The web interface depends on a 'guest' user existing.  You can create this
   with the following command:

     disorder setup-guest

   If you don't want to allow online registration instead use:

     disorder setup-guest --no-online-registration

3. Try it out.  The url will be (something like):

     http://localhost/cgi-bin/disorder

   You should be able to perform read-only operations straight away, and after
   visiting the 'Login' page to authenticate, perform other operations like
   adding a track to the queue.

4. If you run into problems, always look at the appropriate error log; the
   message you see in your web browser will usually not be sufficient to
   diagnose the problem all by itself.

5. If you have a huge number of top level directories, then you might find
   that the 'Choose' page is unreasonably large.  If so add the following line
   to /etc/disorder/options.user:
     label sidebar.choosewhich choosealpha

   This will make 'Choose' be a link for each letter of the 26-letter Roman
   alphabet; follow the link and you just get the directories which start with
   that letter.  The "*" link at the end gives you directories which don't
   start with a letter.

   You can copy choosealpha.html to /etc/disorder and edit it to change the
   set of initial choices to anything that can be expressed with regexps.  The
   regexps must be URL-encoded UTF-8 PCRE regexps.

If you want to give DisOrder its own virtual host, see README.vhost.
