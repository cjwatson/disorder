DisOrder
========

DisOrder is a multi-user software jukebox.
   * It can play either selected tracks or pick tracks at random.
   * It supports OGG, MP3, FLAC and WAV files, and can be configured to support
     anything you can supply a player for (up to a point).
   * It supports both ALSA and OSS and can also broadcast an RTP stream over a
     LAN; a player for the latter is included.
   * Tracks may be selected either via a hierarchical interface or by a fast
     word search.
   * It has a web interface (allowing access from graphical web browsers) and a
     GTK+ interface that runs on Linux and Mac systems.
   * Playing tracks can be paused or cancelled ("scratched").

See CHANGES for details of recent changes to DisOrder.

The server supports Linux and can be made to work on a Mac (see README.mac).
The clients work on both Linux and the Mac.  It could probably be ported to
some other UNIX variants without too much effort.  Things you will need:

Build dependencies:
  Name             Tested              Notes
  libdb            4.3.29              not 4.2.x; 4.4+ might work.
  libgc            6.8
  libvorbisfile    1.1.2
  libpcre          6.7                 need UTF-8 support
  libmad           0.15.1b
  libgcrypt        1.2.3
  libao            0.8.6
  libasound        1.0.13
  libFLAC          1.1.2
  GNU C            4.1.2
  GNU Make         3.81
  GNU Sed          4.1.5
  Python           2.4.4               (optional)
  GTK+             2.8.20              (if you want the GTK+ client)
  GLIB             2.12.4              (if you want the GTK+ client)

"Tested" means I've built against that version; earlier or later versions will
often work too.

Runtime dependencies:
 * Web server:
   + Apache 1.3.x works for me, but anything that supports CGI and
     authentication should be suitable.
 * Separate player programs are no longer required (but may still be used)

Development dependencies (only developers will need these):
  Automake         1.10                AM_PATH_PYTHON not good enough in 1.7
  Autoconf         2.61
  Libtool          1.5.22              1.4 not good enough
  Bazaar (bzr)

On Debian you might ensure you have the required packages as follows:
  apt-get install gcc libc-dev automake autoconf libtool libgtk2.0-dev \
                  libgc-dev libgcrypt-dev libpcre3-dev libvorbis-dev \
                  libao-dev libmad0-dev libasound2-dev libdb4.3-dev \
                  libflac-dev

Installation
============

   "This place'd be a paradise tomorrow, if every department had a supervisor
   with a machine-gun"

NOTE: If you are upgrading from an earlier version, see README.upgrades.

On a Debian system, if you install from .deb files then you should be able to
skip steps 1 to 6 and configure it via debconf.  This is strongly recommended!

1. Build the software.  Do something like this:

     ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var
     make

   See INSTALL for more details about driving configure.  The precise set of
   options you pass to configure is up to you, if you like configuration being
   in /usr/local/etc or wherever then that should work.

   If you only want to build a subset of DisOrder, specify one or more of the
   following options:
     --without-server       Don't build server or web interface
     --without-gtk          Don't build GTK+ client (Disobedience)
     --without-python       Don't build Python support

   See README.client for setting up a standalone client (or read the
   disobedience man page).

2. Install it.  Most of the installation is done via the install target:

     make installdirs install

   The CGI interface has to be installed separately; see under 'Web Interface'
   below.

3. Create a 'jukebox' user and group, with the jukebox group being the default
   group of the jukebox user.  The server will run as this user and group.
   Check that this user can read your music files and write to the audio
   device, e.g. by playing a track.  The exact name doesn't matter, it could be
   'jukebox' or 'disorder' or 'fred' or whatever.

   Do not use a general-purpose user or group, you must create ones
   specifically for DisOrder.

4. Create /etc/disorder/config.  Start from examples/config.sample and adapt it
   to your own requirements.  The things you MUST do are:
    * edit the 'collection' command to identify the location(s) of your own
      digital audio files.  These commands also specify the encoding of
      filenames, which you should be sure to get right as recovery from an
      error here can be painful (see BUGS).
   Optionally you may also want to do the following:
    * add 'player' commands for any file formats not supported natively
    * edit the 'scratch' commands to supply scratch sounds (or delete them if
      you don't want any).
    * add or remove 'stopword' entries as necessary (these words won't take
      part in track name searches from the web interface).

   See disorder_config(5) for more details.

   See README.streams for how to set up network play.

   If adding new 'player' commands, see README.raw for details on setting up
   "raw format" players.  Non-raw players are still supported but not in all
   configurations and they cannot support pausing and gapless play.  If you
   want additional formats to be supported natively please point the author at
   a GPL-compatible library that can decode them.

5. Make sure the server is started at boot time.

   On many Linux systems, examples/disorder.init should be more or less
   suitable; install it in /etc/init.d, adapting it as necessary, and make
   appropriate links from /etc/rc[0-6].d.

6. Start the server.

   On Linux systems with sysv-style init:

     /etc/init.d/disorder start

   By default disorderd logs to daemon.*; check your syslog.conf to see where
   this ends up and look for log messages from disorderd there.  If it didn't
   start up correctly there should be an error message.  Correct the problem
   and try again.

7. After a minute it should start to play something.  Try scratching it (as
   root):

     disorder scratch

   The track should stop playing, and (if you set any up) a scratch sound play.

8. Add any other users you want.  These easiest way to do this is (still as
   root):

     disorder authorize USERNAME

   This will automatically choose a random password and create
   /etc/disorder/config.USERNAME.

   Those users should now be able to access the server from the same host as it
   runs on, either via the disorder command or Disobedience.  To run
   Disobedience from some other host, File->Login allows hostnames, passwords
   etc to be configured.

9. Optionally source completion.bash from /etc/profile or similar, for
   example:

     . /usr/local/share/disorder/completion.bash

   This provides completion over disorder command and option names.


Web Interface
=============

   "Thought I was a gonner baby, but I'm bullet proof"

As above, if you install from a .deb, much of the work will be done
automatically.

You need to configure a number of things to make this work:

1. If you want online registration to work then set mail_sender in
   /etc/disorder/config to the email address that communications from the web
   interface will appear to be sent.  If this is not a valid, deliverable email
   address then the results are not likely to be reliable.

     mail_sender webmaster@example.com

   By default the web interface sends mail by connecting to the SMTP port of
   127.0.0.1.  You can override this with the smtp_server directive, for
   exampler:

     smtp_server mail.example.com

2. The web interface depends on a 'guest' user existing.  You can create this
   with the following command:

     disorder setup-guest

   If you don't want to allow online registration instead use:

     disorder setup-guest --no-online-registration

3. Make sure that DisOrder can find its icons and stylesheet.  For example in
   your web server configuration:

     Alias /disorder/ /usr/local/share/disorder/static/

   Alternatively you could use a symlink from the right location in your
   document root, provided your web server is configured to follow them.

     cd /var/www
     ln -s /usr/local/share/disorder/static disorder

4. Install disorder.cgi in an appropriate location.  Remember to make it
   executable.  Example:

     install -m 755 clients/disorder.cgi /usr/lib/cgi-bin/disorder

5. Try it out.  You should be able to perform read-only operations straight
   away, and after visiting the 'Login' page to authenticate, perform other
   operations like adding a track to the queue.

6. If you run into problems, always look at the appropriate error log; the
   message you see in your web browser will usually not be sufficient to
   diagnose the problem all by itself.

7. If you have a huge number of top level directories, then you might find
   that the 'Choose' page is unreasonably large.  If so add the following line
   to /etc/disorder/options.user:
     label sidebar.choosewhich choosealpha

   This will make 'Choose' be a link for each letter of the 26-letter Roman
   alphabet; follow the link and you just get the directories which start with
   that letter.  The "*" link at the end gives you directories which don't
   start with a letter.

   You can copy choosealpha.html to /etc/disorder and edit it to change the
   set of initial choices to anything that can be expressed with regexps.  The
   regexps must be URL-encoded UTF-8 PCRE regexps.

If you want to give DisOrder its own virtual host, see README.vhost.
