   <h1>2. Window Layout</h1>

   <p>This chapter contains a tour of the main Disobedience
   window.</p>

   <h2><a name=main>2.1 The Disobedience Window</a></h2>
   
   <p>Disobedience should look something like this when you've started
   it up and logged in:</p>

   <p class=image><img src="queue.png"></p>

   <p>At the top is the menu bar, and immediately below it a toolbar
   with some buttons and a volume control.  (In some cases the volume
   control may be absent.)  Below that is a row of
   tabs: <b>Queue</b>, <b>Recent</b> and so on.  The <b>Queue</b> tab
   is selected: this displays the currently playing track and the list
   of tracks that will play in the near future.</p>

   <p>In this example nothing is actually playing.  (Apart from the
   fact that you wouldn't hear anything) you can tell this because the
   top row only has a single length indicator (&ldquo;3:04&rdquo;).
   If it was playing it would show how far through the track it was
   too.  Secondly, all the tracks were chosen at random.  You can tell
   this because the <b>Who</b> column is empty.

   <p>In the screenshot below both of these things have changed.
   Use <tt>rjk</tt> has selected some tracks and the first of them is
   playing.</p>

   <p class=image><img src="queue2.png"></p>

   <p>The playing track is highlighted with a green backgroud.  It's 4
   minutes and 10 seconds long and so far, the first 21 seconds of it
   has played.</p>

   <h2><a name=buttons>2.2 Buttons</a></h2>

   <p>The meaning of the buttons is as follows:</p>

   <table>
     <tr>
       <td><img src="button-pause.png"></td>
       <td>The pause button.  This only effective when a track is
       playing.  When it is pressed the playing track is paused.</td>
     </tr>

     <tr>
       <td><img src="button-scratch.png"></td>
       <td>The scratch button.  As above this is only effective when
       a track is playing.  Pressing it will stop that track playing
       and move onto the next one.</td>
     </tr>

     <tr>
	 <td><img src="button-random.png"></td>

	 <td>The random play button.  Random play, which is enabled
	 when the button is depressed, means that if
	 nothing is playing the server will automatically pick a track
	 at random and play that.  Furthermore it will ensure that the
	 queue always has a minimum number of tracks, so you can see
	 ahead of time what will play next.</td>
     </tr>

     <tr>
	 <td><img src="button-playing.png"></td>
	 <td>The playing button.  Normally this would always be left
	 enabled, i.e. with the button depressed.
         If it is disabled then nothing will be
	 played at all, regardless of whether it was randomly chosen
	 or picked by a human.</td>
     </tr>

     <tr>
	 <td><img src="button-rtp.png"></td>
	 <td>The network play button.  This is only effective if the
	 server is playing over the network (as opposed to using a
	 local sound card).  When network play is enabled,
	 Disobedience runs a client program on your computer to play
	 sound received over the network using your sound card.</td>
     </tr>
   </table>

   <p>To the right of the buttons are two sliders:</p>

   <p class=image><img src="volume-slider.png"></p>

   <p>The left hand slider is the volume control.  This ranges from 0
   (silent) to 10 (loudest).  The right hand slider is the balance
   control, which ranges form -1.0 (left) to +1.0 (right).</p>

   <h2><a name=menu>2.3 The Menu Bar</a></h2>

   <p class=image><img src="menu-server.png"></p>

   <p>The <b>Server</b> menu is loosely analogous to the <b>File</b>
   menu in othe applications.  It has no file-related options though,
   so the name would not be appropriate!  Instead the three options it
   has are <b>Login</b>, which brings back the login window shown the
   first time it is run, <b>Manage Users</b> which allows
   adminstrators to do user management, and <b>Quit</b>.</p>

   <!-- TODO link to user management -->

   <p class=image><img src="menu-edit.png"></p>

   <p>The <b>Edit</b> menu has options to select or deselect all
   tracks.  You can also do this with CTRL-A and CTRL-SHIFT-A, and of
   course you can select tracks in the queue (or other tabs) with the
   mouse.</p>

   <p>The <b>Track Properties</b> option will create a window with
   editable <a href="properties.html">properties</a> of each selected
   track and the <b>Edit Playlists</b> option will create a window
   allowing editing of <a href="playlists.html">playlists</a>.</p>

   <p class=image><img src="menu-control.png"></p>

   <p>The <b>Control</b> menu options are mostly equivalent to the
   buttons described above.  The exceptions is <b>Activate
   Playlist</b> which allows you to play
   a <A href="playlists.html">playlist</a>, and <b>Compact Mode</b>
   which switches Disobedience's window to a smaller format.</p>

   <p class=image><img src="menu-help.png"></p>

   <p>The <b>Help</b> menu has an option to bring up the Disobedience
   manual and an <b>About</b> option which will display a bit of
   version information for the server and for Disobedience (which
   might not be the same).</p>
