   <h1>1. Introduction</h1>

   <p>This chapter covers the following topics:</p>

   <ul>
     <li>What DisOrder and Disobedience are, and how to get them</li>
     <li>How to get a DisOrder login</li>
     <li>How to start Disobedience</li>
   </ul>

   <h2><a name=whatis>1.1 What is DisOrder?</a></h2>

   <p><a href="http://www.greenend.org.uk/rjk/disorder/">DisOrder</a>
   is a multi-user software jukebox.  It allows MP3s, OGGs, etc to be
   played either using a single sound card or over a network to many
   different computers, with multiple different people controlling
   what is played.</p>

   <p>DisOrder has three main user interfaces.</p>

   <ul>
     <li>It has a command-line interface, suitable for ad-hoc use and
     scripting.</li>

     <li>It has a web interface, usable with graphical web browsers
     (Firefox, Internet Explorer etc).</li>

     <li>It has a graphical client called Disobedience.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>This manual is about Disobedience, so it does not really cover
   installation or management issues.  However in this chapter it will
   cover a few such topics as they are necessary to getting up and
   running with Disobedience.</p>

   <!--

   <p>This diagram shows an overview of one possible setup.</p>

   <p class=image><img src="arch-simple.png"></p>

   <p>The server and web interface run on one computer.  Disobedience
   runs on a desktop computer and accesses the server via the network.
   On another system the RTP player runs and plays sound received from
   the server via its local sound card.</p>

   <p>Many other configurations are possible.  For instance the server
   could play directly to a local soundcard.  Also if Disobedience
   runs on the same computer as the RTP player then it can be used to
   stop and start the player.  Of course Disobedience can also be run
   on the same computer as the server provided it can run X11
   applications.</p>

   <h2><a name=getting>1.2 Getting DisOrder</a></h2>

   <p>There are two ways to get DisOrder.</p>

   <p>If you have a Debian system you can download the <tt>.deb</tt>
   files <a href="http://www.greenend.org.uk/rjk/disorder/">from
   DisOrder's home page</a> and install those.  There are four
   packages to choose from:</p>

   <ul>
     <li><tt>disorder.deb</tt> - the base package.  You should always
     install this.  It contains the command-line client.</li>

     <li><tt>disorder-server.deb</tt> - the server and web interface.
     Only install this if you are setting up a totally new DisOrder
     installation.  If you just want to access an existing one, you
     don't need this package.</li>

     <li><tt>disobedience.deb</tt> - the graphical client.  If you are
     reading this manual you want this package!</li>

     <li><tt>disorder-rtp.deb</tt> - the network play client.  If your
     server is set up to transmit sound over the network you will need
     this.  If it uses a local sound card then this package won't be
     useful to you.</li>

   </ul>

   <p>(At the time of writing, DisOrder is not included as part of
   Debian.)</p>

   <p>If you have another kind of Linux system, or a Mac, you must
   build from source code.  See the <tt>README</tt> file included in
   the source distribution for more details.  Note that to use
   Disobedience on a Mac, you will need X11.app.</p>

   <p>There is no Windows support (although the web interface can be
   used from Windows computers).</p>

   <h2><a name=createloging>1.3 Getting a DisOrder login</a></h2>

   <p>The easiest way to get a DisOrder login is to access the web
   interface and set one up using that.  To do this,
   visit <tt>http://HOSTNAME/cgi-bin/disorder</tt>,
   where <tt>HOSTNAME</tt> is the name of the server where DisOrder is
   installed.  You should then be able to select the <b>Login</b>
   option at the top of the screen.</p>

   <p class=image><img src="disorder-web-login.png"></p>

   <p>Go to the <b>New Users</b> form and enter the username you want
   to use, your email address, and a password.  The password must be
   entered twice to verify you did not mistype it (since it won't be
   displayed on the screen).  When you press <b>Register</b>, you will
   be sent an email requiring you to confirm your registration.</p>

   <p class=image><img src="disorder-email-confirm.png"></p>

   <p>Your login won't be active until you click on this URL.</p>

   <p>(It might be that your installation isn't set up to allow
   automatic registration.  In that case the local sysadmin will have
   to create your login and set your initial password by hand.)</p>

   <p>Having done this you could of course just use the web interface.
   But since this is the manual for Disobedience, it is assumed that
   you want to take advantage of its more convenient design and extra
   features.</p>

   <h2><a name=starting>1.4 Starting Disobedience</a></h2>

   <p>On Debian systems it should be possible to find Disobedience in
   the menu system:</p>

   <p class=image><img src="disobedience-debian-menu.png"></p>

   <p>On other systems you will have to start it from the command line
   by typing its name at a command prompt.  You can (optionally) use
   an <tt>&amp;</tt> suffix to stop it tying up your terminal.</p>

   <p class=image><img src="disobedience-terminal.png"></p>

   <p>(Please note that Disobedience shouldn't write any messages to
   the terminal.  If it does that probably indicates a bug, which
   should <a href="http://code.google.com/p/disorder/issues/list">be
   reported</a>.)</p>

   <h2><a name=login>1.5 Initial Login</a></h2>

   <p>The first time you run Disobedience it won't know what server to
   connect to, your username or your password, and will therefore
   display a login box.</p>

   <p class=image><img src="login.png"></p>

   <p>If Disobedience is running on a different computer to the
   server, then you should make sure the <b>Remote</b> box is ticked
   and fill in the host name (or IP address) and port number
   (&ldquo;Service&rdquo;).  If you don't know what values to use
   here, ask your local sysadmin.  If, on the other hand, Disobedience
   is running on the <i>same</i> computer as the server then you can
   leave the <b>Remote</b> box clear and it should be able to connect
   to it without using the network.</p>

   <p>In any case, you will need to enter your username and
   password, as set up earlier.</p>

   <p>Once you have logged in successfuly, Disobedience will remember
   these login settings, so it should not be necessary to enter them
   again.  If you need to change them for any reason, you can either
   select the <b>Server > Login</b> option to bring the login window
   back, or (if you prefer), edit the file <tt>~/.disorder/passwd</tt>
   directly.</p>
