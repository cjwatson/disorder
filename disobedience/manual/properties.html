   <h1>4. Track Properties</h1>

   <p>The chapter describes how to edit track properties.</p>

   <p class=image><img src="track-properties.png"></p>

   <p>This window can be invoked from any of the four tabs by
   selecting one or more tracks and then either selected <b>Edit >
   Track Properties</b> or via the right-click pop-up menu.</p>

   <h2><a name=names>4.1 Track Name Parts</a></h2>

   <p>The first three fields for each track are the parts of its name:
   the artist, album and title.  These control what appear in the
   similarly named columns in the queue and other tabs.  If they are
   wrong then you can edit them here to correct them.</p>

   <p>The double-headed arrow at the right of each field will copy the
   current field value to all the other tracks in the window.  For
   instance if an album name is mis-spelled or wrong then you could
   follow the following procedure to correct it for all its
   tracks:</p>

   <ol>

     <li>In the <b>Choose</b> tab, select all the tracks in the album.</li>

     <li>Select <b>Edit > Track Properties</b> to bring up the track
     properties window.</li>

     <li>Edit the album name in the first track.</li>

     <li>Click the arrow button to the right of the corrected version.</li>

     <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button.</li>

   </ol>

   <h2><a name=tags>4.2 Tags</a></h2>

   <p>Each track has an associated collection of tags.  These can used
   when searching for tracks in the <b>Choose</b> tab or to control
   which tracks are picked at random (although this functionality is
   not readily available in current versions of Disobedience).</p>

   <p>To add tags to a track enter the tags you want to apply to it in
   the <b>Tags</b> field, separated by commas.  Tags cannot contain
   commas and are compared without regard to whitespace.</p>

   <h2><a name=weight>4.3 Track Weight</a></h2>

   <p>Every track has an associated weight.  A higher weight makes the
   track more likely to be picked at random and lower weight makes it
   less likely to be picked at random.  (In the simplest case the
   probability that it will be picked is equal to its weight divided
   by the total weight of all tracks, although there are a number of
   other factors that modify this.)</p>

   <p>If no weight has been explicitly set then the track gets a
   default weight of 90,000.</p>

   <p>One way to prevent a track being picked at random would be to
   set its weight to zero, but in fact there is a box you can untick
   to suppress random selection of tracks too.</p>
