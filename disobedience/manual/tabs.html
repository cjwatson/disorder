   <h1>3. Tabs</h1>

   <p>The chaper contains detailed descriptions of the Queue, Recent,
   Choose and Added tabs.</p>

   <h2><a name=queue>3.1 The Queue</a></h2>

   <p>The <b>Queue</b> tab has already
   been <a href="window.html#main">briefly described</a>, but there
   are some more things to say about.  To start with, the meaning of
   the columns:</p>

   <table>
     <tr>
       <td><b>When</b></td>
       <td>This is the server's estimate of when the track will start.
       If play is disabled but the queue isn't empty, then it is based
       on the assumption that play is about to be enabled.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td><b>Who</b></td>
       <td>This is the person who selected the track.  If the track
       was picked at random by the server it is empty.  You can
       &ldquo;adopt&rdquo; a randomly picked track; see below.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td><b>Artist</b></td>
       <td>The artist responsible for the track.  Like the other track
       name columns, this depends on the server's logic for parsing
       filename, so can be a bit wrong.  You can edit the track
       properties to correct it.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td><b>Album</b></td>
       <td>The album that the track came from.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td><b>Title</b></td>
       <td>The title of the track.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td><b>Length</b></td>
       <td>The length the track will play for.  For the playing track
       this will include the amount of time it's been playing so
       far.</td>
     </tr>
   </table>

   <p>You can select tracks in the queue by clicking on them.  You can
   select multiple tracks by clicking in a second location with SHIFT
   depressed (to select all tracks between the first and second click)
   or with CTRL depressed (to add a single track to the selection).</p>

   <p>Having selected tracks you can drag them to a new location in
   the queue.  Of course, you can't drag the playing track, nor can
   you drag other tracks before it.</p>

   <p>Right-clicking in the queue will create a pop-up menu:</p>

   <p class=image><img src="queue-menu.png"></p>

   <p><b>Track Properties</b> will create a window with editable
   properties of each selected track.  <b>Scratch playing track</b>
   only works if the playing track is the selected track and will stop
   it playing.  <b>Remove track from queue</b> will remove the
   selected (non-playing) tracks from the queue.</p>

   <p><b>Adopt track</b> will apply your name to one without an entry
   in the <b>Who</b> column, i.e. one that was randomly picked by the
   server.  The reason you might do this is to signal to other users
   that you did want this track to play.  (For instance, it might be
   an accepted convention that randomly picked tracks were fair game
   for removal but that tracks picked by a human should normally be
   left alone.)</p>

   <h2><a name=recent>3.2 Recently Played Tracks</a></h2>

   <p class=image><img src="recent.png"></p>

   <p>The <b>Recent</b> tab is similar in structure to the queue but
   it shows tracks that have played recently.  The <b>When</b> column
   indicates when the track played rather than when it will
   played.</p>

   <p>Right clicking will create a pop-up menu with similar options to
   those found in the queue's equivalent menu.  The one additional
   option is <b>Play track</b>, which allows a recently played track
   to be added back to the queue.</p>

   <p>The other way of adding tracks from this tab back to the queue
   is to drag them to the queue tab and then to the desired point into
   the queue.</p>

   <h2><a name=choose>3.3 Choosing Tracks</a></h2>

   <p>The <b>Choose</b> tab contains all the tracks known to the
   server, organized into a hierarchical structure based on the
   underlying file and directory structure.</p>

   <p class=image><img src="choose.png"></p>

   <p>The boxes in the <b>Queued</b> column are ticked if the track is
   somewhere in the queue.  You can click on an unticked box to add
   the track to the queue, but clicking an already-ticked one will
   have no effect.</p>

   <p>Directories can be expanded or collapsed by clicking on the
   triangular signs left of their names.  Tracks can be selected and
   deselected by clicking on them.  You can select multiple tracks by
   clicking in a second location with SHIFT depressed (to select all
   tracks between the first and second click) or with CTRL depressed
   (to add a single track to the selection).</p>

   <p>Right clicking will create a pop-up menu with what are hopefuly
   now familiar options.  <b>Play track</b> will add the selected
   track(s) to the queue and <b>Track Properties</b> will create a
   window with editable properties of each selected track.</p>

   <p>Note that when tracks are added to the queue these ways they
   will be added before any tracks picked at random by the server, so
   that users don't have to wait for them to play out.</p>

   <p>Selected tracks can also be dragged to the queue, by dragging
   first to the <b>Queue</b> tab itself and then to the desired
   location in the queue.</p>

   <p class=image><img src="choose-search.png"></p>

   <p>To do a word search over all tracks, you can just start typing.
   Your search terms will appear in the input box at the bottom of the
   window.  Directories containing matching tracks are automatically
   opened and the matches highlighted in yellow.  You can jump to the
   previous or next search result with the up and down arrows at the
   bottom right of the screen (or jump to the next one by pressing
   CTRL+G).</p>

   <p>To clear the search, press the <b>Cancel</b> button.</p>

   <h2><a name=added>3.4 Newly Added Tracks</a></h2>

   <p>The <b>Added</b> tab shows tracks that have been newly detected
   by the server, in order to allow those tracks to be conveniently
   played.  In behavior it is the same as the
   recently <a href="#recent">played tracks list</a>.</p>
