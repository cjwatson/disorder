   <h1>5. Playlists</h1>

   <p>The chapter describes playlist and how to use them.</p>

   <h2><a name=what>5.1 What are playlists?</a></h2>

   <p>A playlist is a named list of tracks stored by the server.  It
   can be edit by either just its owner or, alternatively, by all
   users.  It can be played as a unit when required.</p>

   <p>Playlists fall into three categories:</p>

   <table>
     <tr>
       <td><b>Shared</b></td>
       <td>Shared playlists have no owner and can be seen and edited
       by anybody.</td>
     </tr>

     <tr>
       <td><b>Public</b></td>
       <td>Public playlist are owned by their creator and can be seen
       by anybody.  Only their creator can edit them, however.</td>
     </tr>

     <tr>
       <td><b>Private</b></td>
       <td>Private playlists are owned by their creator and can only
       be seen or edited by their creator.</td>
     </tr>

   </table>

   <p>To bring up the playlist window, select <b>Edit > Edit
   Playlists</b> from the menu.</p>

   <h2><a name=creating>5.2 Creating Playlists</a></h2>

   <!-- TODO rewrite with screenshots -->

   <p>To create a playlist, click the <b>Add</b> button in the
   playlist editor.  This will create a pop-up window where you can
   enter the name of the new playlist and decide whether it is
   shared, public or private.</p>

   <p>Only Roman letters (without any accents) and digits are allowed
   in playlist names.</p>

   <h2><a name=editing>5.3 Editing Playlists</a></h2>

   <!-- TODO rewrite with screenshots - might be worth waiting until
   picker is a tree -->

   <p>When a playlist is selected, you can edit in the right hand half
   of the playlist window.  The editor is very similar in structure
   and function to the <a href="tabs.html#queue">queue</a>.  You can
   rearrange tracks within it by drag and drop and you can drag tracks
   from the <b>Choose</b> tab into it.</p>

   <h2><a name=playing>5.3 Playing Playlists</a></h2>

   <p>There are three ways to play a playlist:</p>

   <ol>

     <li>Right clicking in the playlist editor will create a pop-up
     menu.  In addition to the familiar options there is an option to
     play this playlist.</li>

     <li>You can select all the tracks and drag them to the desired
     point in the <b>Queue</b> tab.</li>

     <li>You can use <b>Control > Activate Playlist</b> from the main
     menu.</li>

   </ol>
