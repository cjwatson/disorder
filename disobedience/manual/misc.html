   <h1>Appendix</h1>

   <h2><a name=netplay>Network Play</a></h2>

   <p>Network play uses a background copy
   of <tt>disorder-playrtp</tt>.  If you quit Disobedience the
   player will continue playing and can be disabled from a later
   run of Disobedience.</p>

   <p>The player will log to <tt>~/.disorder/HOSTNAME-rtp.log</tt> so
   look there if it does not seem to be working.</p>

   <p>You can stop it without running Disobedience by the command
   <tt>killall disorder-playrtp</tt>.</p>

   <h2><a name=bugs>Reporting Bugs</a></h2>

   <p>Please report bugs using
   DisOrder's <a href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/disorder/issues">bug
   tracker</a>.</p>

   <p>Known problems include:</p>

   <ul>

     <li>There is no particular provision for multiple users of the
     same computer sharing a single <tt>disorder-playrtp</tt> process.
     This shouldn't be too much of a problem in practice but something
     could perhaps be done given demand.</li>

     <li>Try to do remote user management when the server is
     configured to refuse this produces rather horrible error
     behavior.</li>

     <li>Resizing columns doesn't work very well.  This is a GTK+
     bug.</li>

   </ul>
