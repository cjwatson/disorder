   <h2 class=sidebarlink><a name=playing>Playing</a></h2>

   <div class=helpsection>

    <p>This screen displays the currently playing track (if there is one) and
    lists all the tracks in the queue (the track that will be played soonest
    being listed first.)  Where possible, estimated start times are
    given.</p>

    <p>Each track has a <img class=button
       src="@label:images.scratch@"
       title="@label:playing.scratch@"
       alt="@label:playing.scratch@"> button next to it.  For the
       currently playing track this can be used to stop playing the
       track before it has finished.  For a track in the queue it
       removes the track from the queue.</p>

    <p>Depending on the server configuration, you may be able to do
    this for any track, or only for tracks you submitted or that were
    randomly picked.  See the "restrict" option in <a
    href="@url@?action=disorder_config.5">disorder_config(5)</a> for more
    details.</p>

   <p>Artist and album names are hyperlinks to the relevant locations
   in the <a href="#choose">Choose</a> screen (see below).</p>

   </div>

   <h2 class=sidebarlink><a name=manage>Manage</a></h2>

   <div class=helpsection>

    <p>This screen is almost identical to <a
    href="#playing">Playing</a> except that it includes extra
    management features.</p>

   <p>At the top of the screen are the following controls:</p>

   <ul>
    <li>Pause.  This button can be used to pause playing (provided the
    player supports it).  <img width=16 height=16 class=imgbutton
    src="@label:images.enabled@"> indicates that playing is paused,
    <img width=16 height=16 class=imgbutton
    src="@label:images.disabled@"> that it is not.</li>

    <li>Enable/disable random play.  If disabled then queued tracks
    will still be played but if the queue is empty nothing will be
    picked at random.  <img width=16 height=16 class=imgbutton
    src="@label:images.enabled@"> indicates that random play is
    enabled, <img width=16 height=16 class=imgbutton
    src="@label:images.disabled@"> that it is disabled.</li>

    <li>Enable/disable play.  If disabled then tracks in the queue
    will not be played, but will remain in the queue instead.  <img
    width=16 height=16 class=imgbutton src="@label:images.enabled@">
    indicates that play is enabled, <img width=16 height=16
    class=imgbutton src="@label:images.disabled@"> that it is
    disabled.</li>

    <li>Volume control.  You can use the <img class=button
       src="@label:images.up@"
       title="@label:volume.increase@"
       alt="@label:volume.increase@"> and <img
       src="@label:images.down@"
       title="@label:volume.reduce@"
       alt="@label:volume.reduce@"> buttons to increase or
    decrease the volume, or enter new volume settings for the left
    and/or right speakers.</li>

   </ul>

   <p>Below this is the same table of current and queued tracks as for
    the main playing screen, but with extra buttons for managing the
    queue.
    The <img class=button src="@label:images.up@"
     title="@label:playing.up@" alt="@label:playing.up@"> and <img
     src="@label:images.down@" title="@label:playing.down@"
     alt="@label:playing.down@"> buttons on each track move that
    track around in the queue.  Similarly the <img class=button
     src="@label:images.upall@" title="@label:playing.upall@"
     alt="@label:playing.upall@"> and <img
     src="@label:images.downall@" title="@label:playing.downall@"
     alt="@label:playing.downall@"> buttons move each track to the head or
    tail of the queue.
    Depending on server configuration, it may be that only trusted
    users can move tracks around the queue.</p>

   </div>

   <h2 class=sidebarlink><a name=recent>Recent</a></h2>

   <div class=helpsection>

    <p>This screen displays recently played tracks, most recent first.
    The <img class=button src="@label:images.edit@"
    title="@label:choose.prefs@" alt="@label:choose.prefs@">
    button can be used to edit the details for a track; see <a
    href="#prefs">Editing Preferences</a> below.</p>

    <p>The number of tracks remembered is controlled by the server
    configuration.  See the "history" option in <a
    href="@url@?action=disorder_config.5">disorder_config(5)</a> for more
    details.</p>

   </div>

   <h2 class=sidebarlink><a name=new>New</a></h2>

   <div class=helpsection>

    <p>This screen displays tracks recently added to the database,
    most recent first.  The <img class=button
    src="@label:images.edit@" title="@label:choose.prefs@"
    alt="@label:choose.prefs@"> button can be used to edit the details
    for a track; see <a href="#prefs">Editing Preferences</a> below,
    and clicking on the track title will add it to the queue.</p>

    <p>The time tracks are remembered for is controlled by the server
    configuration.  See the "noticed_history" option in <a
    href="@url@?action=disorder_config.5">disorder_config(5)</a> for
    more details.</p>

   </div>

   <h2 class=sidebarlink><a name=choose>Choose</a></h2>

   <div class=helpsection>

    <p>This screen allows you to choose a track to be played, by navigating
     through the directory structure of the tracks filesystem.  The following
     buttons appear:</p>

    <table class=helpbuttons>
     <tbody>
      <tr>
       <td class=helpbuttons><img
       class=button src="@label:images.edit@"
       title="@label:choose.prefs@"
       alt="@label:choose.prefs@"></td>
       <td class=helpbuttons>This button can be used to edit the details for a
       track; see <a href="#prefs">Editing Preferences</a> below.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
       <td class=helpbuttons><span class=button>@label{choose.playall}@</span></td>
       <td class=helpbuttons>This button plays all the tracks in a directory,
       in order.  This is used to efficiently play a whole album.</td>
      </tr>
     </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>This screen has two forms: <a
    href="@url@?action=choose&#38;nonce=@nonce@">choose</a>, which give
    you all the top-level directories at once, and <a
    href="@url@?action=choosealpha&#38;nonce=@nonce@">choosealpha</a>,
    which breaks them down by initial letter.</p>

   </div>

   <h2 class=sidebarlink><a name=prefs>Editing Preferences</a></h2>

   <div class=helpsection>

    <p>This screen, reached from <a href="#choose">Choose</a> or <a
    href="#recent">Recent</a>, is used to edit a track's preferences.
     Preferences can be edited in two ways.</p>
    
    <p>At the top appear "cooked" preferences.  These can be used to
    edit artist, album and title fields for the track as displayed, or
    to set the tags for a track, or to enable or disable random play
    for the track.</p>

    <p>Tags are separated by commas and can contain any other printing
    characters (including spaces).  Leading and trailing spaces are
    not significant.</p>

    <p>Random play for any given track is enabled by default, but you
    can use this screen to disable it for undesirable tracks.</p>

    <p>Below this are "raw" preferences, which allow individual
    database fields to be modified.</p>

    <p>To change an existing preference, edit its value and press its
    <span class=button>@label{prefs.set}@</span> button.</p>

    <p>To delete an existing preference, press its
    <span class=button>@label{prefs.delete}@</span> button.</p>

    <p>To add a new preference, enter its name and value in the box at the
    bottom and press the <span class=button>@label{prefs.new}@</span> button.
    If the preference exists already it will be overwritten.</p>


    <p>Preferences can have any name or value but certain names have special
    significance:</p>

    <table class=helpprefs>
     <tbody>
      <tr>
       <td class=helpprefs><span class=helppref>pick_at_random</span></td>
       <td class=helpprefs>If this preference is present and set to "0" then
       the track will not be picked for random play.  Otherwise it may be.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
       <td class=helpprefs><span class=helppref>trackname_<span class=helpprefbit>context</span>_<span class=helpprefbit>part</span></span></td>
       <td class=helpprefs>These preferences can be used to override the
       filename parsing rules to find a track name part.  <span
       class=helppref>trackname_<span class=helpprefbit>part</span></span> will
       be used if the full version is not present.</td>
     </tbody>
    </table>

    <p><span class=helpprefbit>context</span> can be anything but standard
    values are:</p>

    <table class=helpcontexts>
     <tbody>
      <tr>
       <td class=helpcontexts><span class=helpcontext>display</span></td>
       <td class=helpcontexts>Displayed in a web page</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
       <td class=helpcontexts><span class=helpcontext>sort</span></td>
       <td class=helpcontexts>Used when sorting track names</td>
      </tr>
     </tbody>
    </table>

    <p><span class=helpprefbit>part</span> can be anything too but standard
    values are "artist", "album" and "title", with the obvious meanings.</p>

    <p>See also <a href="@url@?action=disorder.1">disorder(1)</a> and <a
    href="@url@?action=disorder_config.5">disorder_config(5)</a> for further
    details.</p>

   </div>

   <h2 class=sidebarlink>Search</h2>

   <div class=helpsection>

    <p>This screen allows you to search for keywords in track names.  If you
    specify more than one keyword then only tracks containing all of them are
    listed.  Results are grouped by artist, album and title.</p>

    <p>It is possible to limit results to tracks with a particular
    tag, by using <b>tag:</b><i>TAG</i> among the search terms.</p>

    <p>Some keywords, known as "stopwords", are excluded from the search, and
    will never match.  See the "stopword" option in <a
    href="@url@?action=disorder_config.5">disorder_config(5)</a> for further
    details about this.</p>

   </div>

  @if{@eq{@label:menu@}{sidebar}@}
     {

   <h2 class=sidebarlink>Volume</h2>

   <div class=helpsection>

    <p>This screen allows you to set the playback volume, if this is enabled in
    the server configuration.  See the "channel" and "mixer" options in <a
    href="@url@?action=disorder_config.5">disorder_config(5)</a> for further
    details about this.</p>

   </div>

     }{<!-- volume currently only linked in sidebar menu -->}@ 

  <h2 class=sidebarlink>Troubleshooting</h2>

  <div class=helpsection>

   <p>If you cannot play a track, or it does not appear in the
   database even after a rescan, check the following things:</p>

   <ul>

    <li>Are there any error messages in the system log?  The server
    logs to <tt>LOG_DAEMON</tt>, which typically ends up in
    <i>/var/log/daemon.log</i> or <i>/var/log/messages</i>, though
    this depends on local configuration.

    <li>Is the track in a known format?  Have a look at the
    configuration file for the formats recognized by the local
    installation.  The filename matching is case-sensitive.

    <li>Do permissions on the track allow the server to read it?
     
    <li>Do the permissions on the containing directories allow the
    server to read and execute them?

   </ul>

   <p>The user the server runs as is determined by the <tt>user</tt>
   directive in the configuration file.  The README recommends using
   <b>jukebox</b> for this purpose but it could be different
   locally.</p>
