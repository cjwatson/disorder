DisOrder is a software jukebox designed for multi-user environments. It allows users to pick music tracks for play from a shared collection. When nobody has picked anything, it can play randomly picked tracks instead.

There are two main user interfaces: a web interface and a GTK+ client called Disobedience. The latter is somewhat more sophisticated but only runs on UNIX-like systems; however most features are supported by both interfaces.

Tracks can be selected either by navigating through the directory hierarchy or by fast word search. It's also possible to apply tags to tracks and search by tag. Once a track is playing it's possible to cancel it if someone doesn't like it, or to pause it.

Sound can be played via either the ALSA or OSS (/dev/audio) interfaces; via the Mac's native sound API; or broadcast/multicast over a LAN.

Natively, DisOrder supports MP3, OGG, WAV and FLAC files. It's possible to add players for other file formats.
