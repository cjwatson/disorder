DisOrder and Republishing Internet Streams
==========================================

DisOrder doesn't have any built-in support for playing streams but you can make
it do so.  I use the following in my configuration file:

 player /export/radio/*.oggradio shell 'xargs ogg123 -q < "$TRACK"'
 collection fs iso-8859-1 /export/radio

After setting this up you'll need to re-read the config file and provoke a
rescan:

  disorder reconfigure rescan /export/radio

/export/radio contains a file for each stream, containing the URL to use:

 lyonesse$ cat /export/radio/CUR1350.oggradio
 http://cur.chu.cam.ac.uk:8000/cur.ogg

You'll probably want to prevent random play of streams:

 disorder set /export/radio/CUR1350.oggradio pick_at_random 0

You can then queue a stream like any other track.  It won't automatically
interrupt the playing track, you have to scratch it manually.  Go back to
normal play by scratching the stream.


Creating A Stream Of DisOrder Output
====================================

This can be achieved using the speaker_command option and Icecast (see
http://www.icecast.org/).  It will only work if you use the speaker process,
i.e. execraw for everything.

I used:

  speaker_command "ices2 /etc/disorder/ices.xml"

where ices.xml is:

  <?xml version="1.0"?>
  <ices>
      <background>0</background>
      <logpath>/var/log/ices</logpath>
      <logfile>disorder.log</logfile>
      <loglevel>4</loglevel>
      <consolelog>0</consolelog>
      <stream>
	  <metadata>
	      <name>lyonesse</name>
	      <genre>Various</genre>
	      <description>lyonesse disorder output</description>
	  </metadata>
	  <input>
	      <module>stdinpcm</module>
	      <param name="rate">44100</param>
	      <param name="channels">2</param>
	      <param name="metadata">1</param>
	      <param name="metadatafilename">/var/disorder/icedata</param>
	  </input>
	  <instance>
	      <hostname>lyonesse.anjou.terraraq.org.uk</hostname>
	      <port>8000</port>
	      <password>SOURCE PASSWORD HERE</password>
	      <mount>/disorder.ogg</mount>
	      <reconnectdelay>2</reconnectdelay>
	      <reconnectattempts>5</reconnectattempts>
	      <maxqueuelength>80</maxqueuelength>
	      <encode>
		  <nominal-bitrate>64000</nominal-bitrate>
		  <samplerate>44100</samplerate>
		  <channels>2</channels>
		  <flush-samples>8820</flush-samples>
	      </encode>
	  </instance>

	  </stream>
  </ices>

This doesn't seem to get on very well with pausing but you're unlikely to want
to pause a stream in any case.  I used IceCast 2.3.1 and Ices 2.0.1.  You can
play the stream with XMMS or whatever.  The total setup seems to play rather
behind the 'current' time, watch this space for a fix (or contribute one!)

Other DisOrder options you can set are sox_generation which you should set to
if you have a sufficently recent version of sox, due to an incompatile change
in its command syntax; and sample_format which determines what format is
supplied to the speaker_command.  See disorder_config(5) for further
information.
