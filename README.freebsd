DisOrder on FreeBSD
===================

The server builds on FreeBSD, using the ports system to supply many of
its dependencies.  It is not well tested in this environment.  In
particular, since my FreeBSD VM lacks sound support, only network play
has been tested.  Please report successes and failures!

Use gmake to build DisOrder, not BSD make:
  ./configure
  gmake
  sudo gmake install

Then to set up:
  sudo scripts/setup
